It&#8217;s a lot of work to fight with an organization, especially a large one that&#8217;s not particularly reputable.

If you spend 40 hours trying to recoup $200, you&#8217;re making less than minimum wage.<\/p>\n<p>The most important reason to fight back is to make the leaders of the organization think twice before creating a culture of ripping off the customer.  If the customer is apathetic, there is nothing to stop a company from taking its customers&#8217; money from now until the end of time.  And the people who work there understand well that there is not a lot of incentive for the customers to fight (read lawsuit) over relatively small amounts of money.  On the other side of the equation there is a lot of incentive to steal a little here and a little there.  If you have a lot customers, the volume can quickly add up to millions.<\/p>\n<p>Another reason, though, is that small amounts of money do add up over time.  Suppose you pass on an opportunity to recover $1000 per year for 50 years.  This isn&#8217;t really unreasonable.  It&#8217;s probably not far off from what I&#8217;ve lost in the past few years either due to incompetence, mistakes, or outright fraud.  Assuming 8% interest in the stock market after inflation, the present value of that money is about $13,000.  The accumulated value 50 years from now is well over $600,000.  That&#8217;s three Harvard educations!
