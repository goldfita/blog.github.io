They called the day before, but it turned out they wouldn&#8217;t go to my address.  After hanging up, I did some research and found out that there was another store close by.  I had to make numerous calls to two different stores.  Every VCF seems to have a different system for handling calls.  Store 59 has a particularly obnoxious call waiting sound.  It&#8217;s a loud beep every few seconds.  I guess they really don&#8217;t want your call.<\/p>\n<p>Eventually, I thought that they were going to call back to set a new time, but after calling a couple of times, I thought maybe they were avoiding me instead.  So that evening, I sent a nasty email through their website.  This may have been a little premature.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\nHello, I waited a week and a half to have a service person sent out to fix my new sofa.  Then I was told store 59 doesn&#8217;t go to [removed].  After several more phone calls, I found out that store 74 does service [removed].  I&#8217;ve called twice and was supposed to receive a return call.<\/p>\n<p>Please take a look at the wonderful quality of this Value City Furniture product!  I was not expecting luxury for under $1000, but is it too much to ask that it at least be functional?  These photos go up on my blog next week.<\/p>\n<p>In the mean time, I spent a lot of money on this nearly functional sofa bed, and I plan to use it.  It&#8217;s really wobbly though; I hope I don&#8217;t get hurt.  I don&#8217;t suppose you know what jury awards for product liability torts go for these days?  It&#8217;s probably a little more than the three dollars in gas it will take to send the service tech out here.  Anyhow, give me a call.\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I provided links to the following images.<br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/blog.signalsguru.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/bed1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.signalsguru.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/bed1-300x224.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"bed1\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-143\" srcset=\"http:\/\/blog.signalsguru.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/bed1-300x224.jpg 300w, http:\/\/blog.signalsguru.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/bed1-1024x764.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/blog.signalsguru.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/bed2.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.signalsguru.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/bed2-300x224.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"bed2\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-147\" srcset=\"http:\/\/blog.signalsguru.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/bed2-300x224.jpg 300w, http:\/\/blog.signalsguru.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/bed2-1024x764.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I called again the next morning and they finally agreed to send a service technician.  There was also some whining about how they weren&#8217;t really supposed to do this since I picked the sofa up myself rather than paying for the delivery fee.  Later in the day, someone called about the email I had sent.  I told him store 74 had agreed to send someone out; he sounded relieved.  Now we&#8217;ll find out if they can actually fix the problem.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>See last post. VCF set a time.
