So I recently filed for Summary Ejectment in District Court against my tenant who had fallen months behind on rent. I took off work the morning of the trial to prepare and to try again to contact the tenant&#8217;s aide program. As luck would have it, I finally got through to someone in the aide program after a couple months of being ignored, and they informed me they intended to pay the back rent if I sent some additional paperwork. Fantastic! I really did not want to go to court.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After sending in the paperwork, I spent the next hour trying to get the District Court on the phone. Then I continued to call them throughout the day. No response. I also tried emailing, though it wasn&#8217;t easy to find email addresses. The court website said there were no closures due to weather. I finally found out that night that the governor had given state employees the day off sometime during the week. The court rescheduled all the trials for that day but didn&#8217;t bother to tell anyone. There wasn&#8217;t even recorded message when you dialed in stating that the court was closed. Nothing. I took off of work for this. My tenant may have taken off of work too, and she already isn&#8217;t paying her bills. But I guess it&#8217;s too much of a hassle for the court to call people and let them know of new, critical information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the court reopened, I called them to let them know I wanted to dismiss the case. You can&#8217;t do this over the phone. They told me I had to either send them some paperwork or call the day of the trial and send a court room message to dismiss. Well, I was out of town now, so I decided I would call the day of. I got up early since they rescheduled for the morning. And when I called in, they told me something different, that there is no need to do anything. If you&#8217;re the plaintiff, and you want to dismiss, just don&#8217;t show up. Wonderful. If I had know that a week earlier, I could have simply done nothing and saved about five hours.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you&#8217;ve ever dealt with governments, either as an ordinary citizen or working for a government is some capacity, you probably know governments tend to place a value of zero on your time and routinely fail to communicate timely or at all.
