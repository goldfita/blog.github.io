I pay the taxes that fund its employees salaries; it ignores me.  Its employees do not respond to my emails unless it&#8217;s forwarded on by the CFPB.  They always find a way to interpret the law in such a way that they don&#8217;t actually have to do any work.  I wanted to find out if they were ignoring or discriminating against me, so I created an email account under a Hispanic name.  I emailed an inarticulate complaint in broken English, and it took a week, but they responded by opening a case number and asking for more information.  So I feel justified when I say they really don&#8217;t like me.<\/p>\n<p>The Credit Union (C from here on) banned me from using its services.  Just to be a thorn in its side, I sent a complaint to the CFPB.  I stated that Section 1764 of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ncua.gov\/Legal\/Documents\/fcu_act.pdf\" title=\"Federal Credit Union Act\">Federal Credit Union Act<\/a> gives me the right to be heard prior to expulsion by a formal vote.  The CFPB forwarded my complaint to the NCUA.  It emailed the following response and then immediately closed the ticket so that I had no way of responding.  The respondent did not ask any questions about the situation or attempt to be of any help.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>As a member of a Federal Credit Union, the Federal Credit Union Act (FCU Act), grants all members\u2019 two basic rights: the right to maintain a share account and the right to vote at annual meetings. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a71759, 1769. However, nothing in the FCU Act or NCUA\u2019s Rules and Regulations precludes a FCU from restricting the availability of certain services provided there is a rational basis for such action. See Legal Opinion Letter 08-0431 (available at www.ncua.gov). The credit union is within their right to limit services to some members.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ncua.gov\/Legal\/Pages\/OL2008-0431.aspx\" title=\"Legal Opinion\">Legal Opinion<\/a> referenced here states that there needed to be some loss by C.  And further, C would need to provide me with a formal policy of suspension of services.  I don&#8217;t know whether such a policy exists, but I was not offered one or told where it could be found.  Further, at the time I discovered C had banned me, I don&#8217;t believe I had actually cost C a single penny.<\/p>\n<p>The NCUA would not respond to me.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The NCUA seems to be going out of its way to be unhelpful to me.
