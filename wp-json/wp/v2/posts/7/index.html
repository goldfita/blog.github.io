it&#8217;s no longer clear.\u00a0 That was at least somewhat understandable since there was no appraisal yet.<\/p>\n<p>The summary also showed the origination percentage and the discount points.\u00a0 The origination percentage was not at all clear.\u00a0 I would later learn that they lumped a fixed fee in with origination fee, but it was not documented at that time, nor was it ever documented.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This poor habit of neither disclosing, nor documenting, as well as lumping together the various fees would later become a problem.\u00a0 But at the time I had not figured out what was going on yet.\u00a0 Many of the rest of the loan summary numbers were apparently made up: recordation fees, attorney&#8217;s fees, title insurance, transfer tax, etc.\u00a0 I don&#8217;t have a problem with making some estimates, but if most of the numbers on a loan summary are meaningless, then why even bother providing a loan summary at all?\u00a0 This would become another theme throughout the refinancing process.\u00a0 <em>The paperwork is treated as some law or regulation that stands in the way of business.<\/em> They gave me the paperwork, and even though every single documented number might as well have been wrong, they seemed to be satisfied that their obligations to me were met.\u00a0 The paperwork isn&#8217;t there just to make some regulator happy.\u00a0 Some of us actually read this stuff.\u00a0 It needs to be correct.<\/p>\n<p>Next I received the rate lock and loan points agreements (one of them came with the other loan summary).\u00a0 The mortgages were still swapped at this point.\u00a0 Also, curiously, the dates did not add up.\u00a0 The commitment period began 8\/31\/2010 and ended 10\/15\/2010, but it also said I had 60 days.\u00a0 At the time I didn&#8217;t care very much about the obvious conflict, but it would later become extremely stressful not knowing when the lock expired because they were unable to process my loan in any reasonable amount of time.<\/p>\n<p>At this point I started requesting that at least some of the documentation be fixed.\u00a0 I wasn&#8217;t about to send two $500 checks for appraisals with the mortgage amounts still swapped.\u00a0 I wasn&#8217;t angry yet; everyone makes mistakes.\u00a0 But they ignored my requests to fix the problems, and so I asked again.\u00a0 And again.\u00a0 To be continued&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>OK, so it&#8217;s really a credit union.\u00a0 Back in August of 2010, when mortgage rates were at all time lows, I decided to refinance both an investment property and what used to be my primary residence before I lost my job.\u00a0 NASA Federal Credit Union was ranked A+ by the BBB.\u00a0 My brother had used &hellip;<\/p>\n<p class=\"read-more\"> <a class=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/blog.signalsguru.net\/archives\/7\"> <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Banks Behaving Badly<\/span> Read More &raquo;<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"site-sidebar-layout":"default","site-content-layout":"default","ast-global-header-display":"","ast-main-header-display":"","ast-hfb-above-header-display":"","ast-hfb-below-header-display":"","ast-hfb-mobile-header-display":"","site-post-title":"","ast-breadcrumbs-content":"","ast-featured-img":"","footer-sml-layout":"","theme-transparent-header-meta":"","adv-header-id-meta":"","stick-header-meta":"","header-above-stick-meta":"","header-main-stick-meta":"","header-below-stick-meta":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/blog.signalsguru.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/blog.signalsguru.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/blog.signalsguru.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/blog.signalsguru.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/blog.signalsguru.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=7"}],"version-history":[{"count":7,"href":"http:\/\/blog.signalsguru.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":13,"href":"http:\/\/blog.signalsguru.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7\/revisions\/13"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/blog.signalsguru.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=7"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/blog.signalsguru.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=7"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/blog.signalsguru.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=7"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
