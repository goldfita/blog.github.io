The contract shows the true purchase price to be $129,293.  It is clear at this point that the county is trying to manipulate the housing market by reporting invalid purchase prices, possibly for the purpose of increasing tax revenues.  After correcting for seller subsidies of closing costs, where possible, and adding a few comparables of my own, the corrected sale prices were computed and sorted.  The properties that sold for more were generally well fixed up; the properties that sold for less needed significant work.  My home was assessed in the top half, both by mean and median.<br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/blog.signalsguru.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/03\/reworked_comparables.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.signalsguru.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/03\/reworked_comparables-300x97.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Reworked Comparables\" width=\"300\" height=\"97\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-124\" srcset=\"http:\/\/blog.signalsguru.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/03\/reworked_comparables-300x97.jpg 300w, http:\/\/blog.signalsguru.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/03\/reworked_comparables.jpg 578w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n<\/em><br \/>\nVictim<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I&#8217;d like my taxes to be reassessed to the value I purchased the house for on the open market.
